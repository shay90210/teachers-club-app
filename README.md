## Re-done React project using Typescript and Redux. In my last e-commerce project, I went through major errors that were completely unnoticeable to me. I couldn't define where the errors where coming from after completing an entire project, yet my project would not deploy on Netlify. To rectify the intracies that I faced and to ensure a successful project, I recompleted the project using Typescript to ensure that any each step that I code improves my editor support along with catching mistakes in my editor before any runtime for testing.

## Also, I want to ensure that my project is continuously deployable catching any errors after making a commit with any changes. This strategy ensured that I caught the mistakes in the deploy log and can easily revert back to the code to correct the errors. Lastly, I created more notes throughout the project to ensure that I understood not only what the functions of the code is supposed to achieve within the various pages, but also noting any errors that I received and should avoid to prevent my code from crashing.
