## INTRODUCTION 

- I completed my React project using Typescript and Redux. In my last e-commerce project, I went through significant errors that were unnoticeable. I couldn't define where the errors came from after completing an entire project, yet my project would not deploy on Netlify. To rectify the intricacies that I faced and ensure a successful project, I redid this project using Typescript to ensure that each step that I code improves my editor support and catches mistakes in my editor before any runtime for testing.

- I also wanted to ensure that my project was continuously deployable, catching any errors after making a commit with any changes. This strategy ensured that I noticed the mistakes in the deploy log and could quickly reverse the code to correct the errors. Lastly, I created more notes throughout the project to ensure that I understood not only what the code's functions were supposed to achieve within the various pages but also noted any errors I received and should avoid preventing my code from crashing.

## WHAT ISSUE WILL THIS PROJECT SOLVE?
- This project will solve an issue for both the company and the consumer, the system will automatically order more items once the products are low in stock. Also, the system will allow the consumer to register with their email to receive a notification when the product is back in stock.
