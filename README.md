# React && Redux && Typescript E-Commerce Application

### I completed my React project using Typescript and Redux. In my last e-commerce project, I went through significant errors that were unnoticeable. I couldn't define where the errors came from after completing an entire project, yet my project would not deploy on Netlify. To rectify the intricacies that I faced and ensure a successful project, I redid this project using Typescript to ensure that each step that I code improves my editor support and catches mistakes in my editor before any runtime for testing.

### I also wanted to ensure that my project was continuously deployable, catching any errors after making a commit with any changes. This strategy ensured that I noticed the mistakes in the deploy log and could quickly reverse the code to correct the errors. Lastly, I created more notes throughout the project to ensure that I understood not only what the code's functions were supposed to achieve within the various pages but also noted any errors I received and should avoid preventing my code from crashing.
